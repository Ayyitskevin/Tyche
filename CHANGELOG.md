## Unreleased

### Crypto market-structure depth (Gödel-gap roadmap · Theme A)

Widening Tyche's biggest edge over the equities-first incumbent — crypto depth —
with deterministic analytics over the existing keyless market-structure data:

- **`LIQ` — order-book liquidity analytics** (aliases `LIQUIDITY`/`SLIP`/`MBOOK`):
  a new `bookAnalytics` + `costToFill` pair in `@tyche/analytics` adds the
  microstructure the raw `BOOK` ladder doesn't — the size-weighted **microprice**,
  spread in **basis points**, resting **depth within ±bps price bands** (per-side
  quantity/notional + imbalance), and **cost-to-fill / slippage** for market orders
  that walk the book (volume-weighted average price and slippage vs mid, with partial
  fills flagged, never extrapolated). Reuses the existing `orderBook` capability — no
  new data path — and is pure, deterministic, and null-safe when a side is empty.
  Descriptive market-structure analytics, not a signal and not advice.

- **`CARRY` — perp funding carry analytics** (aliases `FUNDINGANALYTICS`/`FUNDX`/`BASIS`):
  a new `fundingAnalytics` helper in `@tyche/analytics` turns the raw `fundingRates`
  board into cross-sectional market structure — per-perp daily/annualized carry, the
  mark-vs-index **premium** in basis points (null when the venue omits a mark or index
  price — never fabricated), a documented carry **regime** (rich ≥ +30% APR · elevated
  +10–30% · neutral ±10% · negative < −10%), and how rich each perp's carry is versus the
  board (deviation from the cross-sectional median + percentile), plus median-APR /
  longs-pay-share / dispersion headline tiles. Reuses the existing `fundingRates`
  capability — no new data path — and is pure, deterministic, and null-safe on degenerate
  input. Descriptive market-structure analytics, not a signal and not advice.

### Analytics depth — Phase 1 (Bloomberg-gap roadmap)

Kicking off the gap-analysis roadmap with the highest-leverage, zero-new-data win:

- **Portfolio risk analytics core** (`@tyche/analytics`) — a new `portfolioRisk`
  module adds the multi-asset / benchmark-relative layer on top of the existing
  single-series risk math: covariance, Pearson correlation + correlation matrix,
  beta, downside deviation, Sortino, Calmar, annualized (geometric) return,
  tracking error, information ratio, weighted portfolio-return aggregation, and a
  `portfolioRiskStats` headline bundle. Pure functions over aligned return series,
  all NaN/zero-variance/short-history safe; educational analytics only.
- **`PORT` risk panel** — a **Risk** toggle in the portfolio panel computes and
  shows annualized return/volatility, Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar, max drawdown,
  95% VaR, and benchmark-relative beta / tracking error / information ratio for
  the whole book. Backed by a new `GET /api/portfolios/:id/risk?benchmark=SPY`
  that fetches each holding's daily history + the benchmark, aligns by date,
  market-value-weights the positions, and computes the bundle — provenance-
  stamped, graceful when a symbol lacks history (coverage is reported), and works
  keyless in mock mode. Read-only analytics; still no orders, ever.
- **FA `Ratios` view — derived fundamental analytics.** A new `fundamentals`
  module in `@tyche/analytics` groups the income/balance/cash-flow line items we
  already fetch into per-period bundles and derives margins (gross/operating/
  net/FCF), returns (ROA/ROE), leverage & efficiency (debt-to-equity, debt-to-
  assets, asset turnover), and period-over-period growth. The **FA** panel gains a
  fourth **Ratios** tab that renders those ratios and YoY/QoQ growth rows across
  the same period columns as the statements — pure math over data already on
  screen, null-safe on sparse statements, no new data source or key. Export stays
  on the raw-statement tabs. Educational analytics only.
- **Technical-indicator library** (`@tyche/analytics/technicals`) — a broad,
  pure indicator set over OHLCV arrays, ready to back chart studies: **MACD**
  (line/signal/histogram), **Bollinger Bands**, **ATR** (+ true range),
  **Stochastic** (%K/%D), **Williams %R**, **CCI**, **OBV**, **VWAP** (anchored),
  **ADX/DMI** (+DI/−DI/ADX, Wilder), **ROC**, **momentum**, and **Ichimoku**
  (conversion/base/spans/lagging with a forward-displaced cloud), plus rolling
  min/max and population-σ helpers. Every function returns an input-length series
  with warm-up nulls (the `sma`/`ema`/`rsi` convention) and is zero-range safe (a
  flat window yields the neutral value, never NaN). Educational analytics only;
  the chart-study wiring lands next.
- **Chart studies — Bollinger Bands + MACD.** The GP/GIP charts gain two new
  toggles: **Boll** draws Bollinger Bands (20, 2σ upper/lower + dashed mid) over
  the price scale, and **MACD** adds a stacked lower study pane (histogram around
  a zero baseline + MACD/signal lines). The `AdvancedChart` lower panes now stack
  (MACD above RSI) and reflow so the price pane stays usable; both toggles persist
  in panel state like SMA/EMA/RSI. Overlay-only Economics/Comparison charts are
  untouched (the new props default off).
- **Options analytics** (`@tyche/analytics/optionsAnalytics`) — a higher-level
  layer on the Black–Scholes core: **implied volatility** (bisection solve, robust
  where vega → 0, null when a quote can't be matched), **strategy payoff**
  (per-leg and combined P/L, an evenly-sampled payoff curve, zero-crossing
  **breakevens**, and a max-profit/max-loss summary), open-interest **max pain**
  (the expiry strike minimizing total intrinsic payout), and **IV skew** (finite-IV
  points by strike, filterable by type/expiry) over the `OptionChain` contract.
  Pure functions, degenerate-input safe; educational analytics only. The
  OMON/OVME wiring lands next.
- **OMON max-pain readout.** The option-chain panel now derives the **max-pain**
  strike from the selected expiry's open interest and shows it in the expiry bar,
  with that strike's row highlighted in the calls/puts grid. Descriptive analytics
  computed from data already on screen — no new data, no advice.
- **OVME payoff-at-expiry diagram.** The option pricer now draws a compact inline
  payoff curve for the modeled long option (two-tone green/red P/L, zero baseline,
  strike + spot markers, breakeven dots) with a max-loss / breakeven caption, from
  `optionsAnalytics.payoffCurve`/`breakevens`. Pure SVG, recomputed live as the
  inputs change; educational analytics only.
- **Chart studies — VWAP + Stochastic.** Two more GP/GIP toggles: **VWAP** draws
  the anchored volume-weighted average price over the price scale, and **Stoch**
  adds a %K/%D lower pane with 20/80 bands. The `AdvancedChart` lower-pane system
  now stacks up to three panes (MACD, Stochastic, RSI) and reflows the price pane
  when height is tight; both toggles persist in panel state.
- **Deeper financial statements (Phase 2).** FA now shows a fuller statement set,
  pulled from the **same** SEC XBRL company-facts document already fetched (no new
  request): income adds **R&D, SG&A, interest expense, income tax**; the balance
  sheet adds **current assets, inventory, current liabilities**; cash flow adds
  **D&A and share-based compensation**. The real `SecEdgarProvider` maps the
  matching us-gaap concepts (absent concepts render as "—", so the FA matrix stays
  stable across issuers) and the mock emits the same keys with seeded values.
  Keyless, license-clean; sets up liquidity/coverage ratios next.
- **Liquidity & coverage ratios.** With the deeper balance sheet in place, the FA
  **Ratios** view gains a **Liquidity** section — **current ratio** and **quick
  ratio** (inventory-excluded) — plus **interest coverage** (operating income ÷
  interest expense) under leverage. Null-safe over sparse statements; educational
  analytics only.
- **`FTS` — filing full-text search (SEC EDGAR).** A new keyless capability
  (`filingSearch`) and command: search the full text of filings **across all
  issuers** and jump straight to the matched document. The real `SecEdgarProvider`
  queries EDGAR's public EFTS index (`efts.sec.gov`), maps hits to
  `FilingSearchHit` (filer, form, date, direct Archives URL), and degrades a
  blocked/rate-limited response to an empty envelope; the mock returns synthetic
  cross-issuer hits so it works offline. Wired end to end — contract + capability,
  provider method + conformance probe, `GET /api/filings-search`, apiClient, and a
  `FilingSearchModule` with a submit-on-enter query box and results table. Keyless,
  license-clean, no bundling.
- **`INSD` — insider transactions (Form 3/4/5).** A new keyless capability
  (`insiderTransactions`) and command surfacing Section-16 insider buys & sells.
  The real `SecEdgarProvider` reads the issuer's submissions feed, fetches recent
  Form 4/5 ownership documents (bounded, throttled), and parses them with a pure,
  dependency-free `parseForm4` (owner, relationship, non-derivative transactions —
  date/code/shares/price/acquired-disposed/post-holding), degrading a bad document
  to a skip and a total failure to an empty envelope. The mock emits synthetic
  transactions so it works offline. Wired end to end — contract + capability,
  provider method + conformance probe, `GET /api/insiders/:symbol`, apiClient, and
  an `InsiderModule` (buy/sell-toned table, filer links, CSV/JSON export). Keyless,
  license-clean; descriptive, not advice.
- **`ECO` analytics transforms — YoY / period-change / index-to-100.** The economic
  series panel gains a transform chip row that re-expresses the fetched FRED series
  client-side, no new request: **YoY %** (vs the observation ~1 calendar year
  earlier), **Δ% prd** (vs the previous point — QoQ for GDP, MoM for CPI, DoD for
  DGS10), and **Index=100** (rebased to 100 at the window start). The transforms are
  pure and frequency-agnostic (a cadence-scaled year-ago matcher handles the mixed
  quarterly/monthly/daily series without mis-comparing periods), leave early points
  with no counterpart null rather than wrong, and flow through the chart, headline
  change, units readout, and table. Educational analytics only; no advice.
- **`DCF` — discounted-cash-flow valuation sandbox (+ reverse DCF).** A new
  analytics command and `@tyche/analytics` `dcf` module: project and discount a
  base free cash flow over an explicit horizon, add a Gordon-growth terminal value,
  and net debt to an enterprise / equity value and per-share fair value. The
  **reverse DCF** inverts the model — a bisection solves for the growth rate the
  current market cap implies — and a **WACC × terminal-growth sensitivity grid**
  sweeps the valuation. Every result is null-safe where the model is undefined
  (most importantly when the discount rate does not exceed terminal growth, where a
  Gordon perpetuity diverges). The `DCF` panel's assumptions (growth / terminal /
  WACC / horizon) and facts (base FCF / shares / net debt) are editable and persist;
  given a ticker they **seed best-effort** from its latest annual filing
  (`freeCashFlow`, `totalDebt − cashAndEquivalents`) and security master (shares,
  market cap), then show intrinsic value, upside vs. the current price, the
  market-implied growth, and the sensitivity grid. Pure client-side analytics over
  data already fetched — no new capability, keyless, works fully in mock mode.
  Educational only; not investment advice, and Tyche places no orders.
- **`RV` — relative-value peer-comps grid.** The companion to `DCF`: a comps table
  benchmarking a subject against a peer set on **P/E, P/S, P/B, EV/EBITDA, EV/Sales,
  FCF yield**, and **gross / operating / net margins** + **revenue growth**, with a
  **peer-median** row and the subject's premium/discount to that median on each
  valuation multiple. The `@tyche/analytics` `relativeValue` core is pure and
  null-safe — a loss-making P/E, negative-equity P/B, or negative-EBITDA multiple
  reads “—” (not meaningful) rather than a misleading number. The command seeds the
  peer set from the typed line (`AAPL RV MSFT GOOGL`) and the panel lets you add or
  remove peers; multiples are computed from each ticker's latest annual filing +
  market cap (fetched per peer, subject drives the capability ladder). CSV/JSON
  export carries the raw multiples. Keyless, works fully in mock mode; educational
  analytics, not advice.
- **`YCRV` — Treasury yield curve.** A new market-data command plotting the US
  Treasury constant-maturity curve (1M → 30Y) from FRED's `DGS*` series, with
  **today / 1M-ago / 1Y-ago** overlays for shape comparison, headline **2s10s /
  3m10y / 5s30s** spreads (long − short, negative = inverted), and a per-tenor
  yield table with CSV/JSON export. Each tenor is fetched in one batch and read
  "as of" each snapshot date via a pure, null-safe nearest-on-or-before picker
  (`yieldCurve.ts`, unit-tested). The mock's economic catalog gains the full set of
  Treasury tenors (a realistic mildly front-inverted curve) so YCRV works fully
  offline. Keyless; descriptive market data, not investment advice.
- **`ECOC` — economic release calendar (new `economicReleases` capability).** A
  full vertical adding the macro data-release calendar: upcoming and just-published
  prints (CPI, GDP, Nonfarm Payrolls, FOMC, PCE, …) with **actual / previous /
  consensus**, importance, and the actual-vs-consensus **surprise**, split into
  Upcoming / Recent with an importance filter and CSV/JSON export. Wired end to end
  — `EconomicRelease` contract + schema-registry + capability key, `getEconomicReleases`
  on the provider interface + StubProvider + conformance probe, a realistic
  synthetic calendar in the **mock**, a real **FredProvider** adapter over FRED's
  `/releases/dates` (curated to high-signal releases, key never leaked in
  provenance), `GET /api/econ-releases` + apiClient, and the `EconCalendarModule`.
  Consensus is only populated where a source carries estimates — the real FRED
  adapter leaves it null rather than fabricating it. Keyless in mock mode,
  BYO-key for live FRED; descriptive market data, not investment advice.
- **`WACC` — cost of capital (CAPM + WACC).** A pure-analytics helper that closes
  the loop on `DCF`: it derives the discount rate instead of leaving it a guess.
  `@tyche/analytics` gains a `capm` module — `costOfEquity` (rᶠ + β·ERP),
  `afterTaxCostOfDebt` (the tax shield), and a value-weighted `wacc` (null-safe when
  total capital is zero) — and the `WACC` panel computes cost of equity, after-tax
  cost of debt, capital weights, and WACC from editable inputs that **seed from a
  ticker**: β is estimated from 5y daily returns vs. SPY, equity from market cap,
  and debt from the latest balance sheet. Points the user to carry the result into
  the DCF discount rate. Keyless, works fully in mock mode; educational analytics,
  not investment advice.
- **Real news via GDELT (`N` / `TOP`).** A new `GdeltNewsProvider` serves the `news`
  capability from the **keyless GDELT DOC 2.0** API, so headlines are real instead of
  synthetic when enabled (`TYCHE_PROVIDERS=gdelt,mock`). A symbol query searches the
  ticker in a finance context, a keyword passes through, and a bare query returns the
  global markets feed; GDELT's `seendate` is normalized to ISO and `symbols` is echoed
  from the query (GDELT carries no ticker tags). A blocked/rate-limited/failed request
  **degrades to an empty feed** rather than an error, and mock news still serves in
  offline/mock-only deployments — the keyless-and-offline invariant holds. Fixture-
  tested (mapping, query building, graceful-empty, conformance, registry routing) and
  documented in `DATA_PROVIDERS.md`. Descriptive third-party news, not advice.
- **`CORR` — return-correlation matrix.** A new analytics command that plots the
  pairwise Pearson correlation of daily returns across a symbol set as a diverging
  heatmap (red → neutral → green), over a selectable window. The comp set seeds from
  the typed line (`AAPL CORR MSFT NVDA`) and is editable in-panel; correlations use
  the existing pairwise-aligned, zero-variance-safe `correlationMatrix`, and the grid
  exports to CSV. Pure client-side analytics over the price history the terminal
  already serves — keyless, works fully in mock mode. Educational analytics, not
  investment advice.

- **Real equity prices via Stooq (`GP` / `HP` / `QM`).** A new `StooqProvider` serves the
  `quotes`, `batchQuotes`, and `historicalPrices` capabilities from Stooq's **keyless
  end-of-day** CSV feed, so charts and quotes show real equity/ETF/index data instead of the
  mock walk when enabled (`TYCHE_PROVIDERS=stooq,binance,frankfurter,gdelt,mock`). Quotes are
  derived from the two most recent daily closes; `servesSymbol` scopes the adapter to
  equity-shaped tickers (US tickers get the `.us` suffix), so crypto (`BTC-USDT` → Binance) and
  FX (`EUR-USD` → Frankfurter) keep routing to their venue adapters, and mock still serves
  equity prices when Stooq is off. EOD-tier, cached and throttled; real-time is a
  bring-your-own-key upgrade. Fixture-tested (CSV parse, quote derivation, servesSymbol scoping,
  graceful error, conformance, registry routing) and documented in `DATA_PROVIDERS.md`.
  Research-only; not investment advice.

- **Real-time equity quotes via Finnhub (bring-your-own-key).** A new `FinnhubProvider` serves the
  `quotes` / `batchQuotes` capabilities from Finnhub's HTTP API using the operator's **own free API
  key** (`FINNHUB_API_KEY`), so `Q` and watchlists show a **live** last price instead of Stooq's
  end-of-day close. Registered **before** Stooq (`TYCHE_PROVIDERS=finnhub,stooq,binance,…`), so a
  live quote wins per symbol while history — which Finnhub gates behind premium — honestly stays on
  the keyless EOD adapter. `mode: user_supplied`, `tier: live`: this is *your* licensed feed, never
  data Tyche bundles or resells; the key travels only as the `token` request param and never lands
  in provenance or errors. `servesSymbol` scopes it to US equity tickers, so crypto/FX pairs and
  `^`-indices keep routing to their existing adapters, and without a key it simply isn't registered
  (Stooq/mock serve quotes — nothing breaks). Fixture-tested (payload mapping, non-positive-OHLC
  guard, derived change, best-effort batch, servesSymbol scoping, key-absent/auth/rate-limit errors,
  conformance, registry routing) and documented in `DATA_PROVIDERS.md`. Research-only; not
  investment advice.

- **Valuation-multiples history (`MULT`).** A new `MULT` / `MULTIPLES` / `VALH` command shows **trailing
  P/E and P/S at each reported annual fiscal year-end** — the reported EPS and sales-per-share paired
  with the share price on that fiscal date — plus the **current** multiples (latest price ÷ most-recent
  reported year) and the historical **min/avg/max band**. A new pure `valuationHistory` helper in
  `@tyche/analytics` computes it, folding the fundamentals + price-history fetches into one request so
  one loading/error ladder covers both. Honesty guards: a **P/E is null (`—`) when earnings were zero or
  negative** — never a fabricated or negative multiple — and the panel notes it covers only the last few
  reported years (the SEC company-facts subset caps annual history). Reuses the existing keyless
  `fundamentals` + `historicalPrices` capabilities — no new capability, route, or API client — and works
  fully in mock mode. Unit-tested (price-on-fiscal-date pairing, current multiples, min/avg/max bands,
  negative-EPS null, empty set) and an e2e. Descriptive over reported filings and past prices — not a
  valuation opinion, not investment advice.

- **Return seasonality (`SEAS`).** A new `SEAS` / `SEASONALITY` command shows how an instrument has
  historically performed in each **calendar month** — average and median month-end return, hit rate
  (% positive), best/worst, and the sample size (N years) — over its price history. A new pure
  `seasonality` helper in `@tyche/analytics` derives month-end closes and groups the resulting monthly
  returns by calendar month; a never-observed month reads `—` (count 0), never a fabricated 0. Because
  each month carries only a handful of observations (about one per year), the panel labels the sample
  size per row and frames the view as a descriptive tally of past months — explicitly **not a seasonal
  forecast**. Reuses the existing `historicalPrices` capability — no new capability, route, or API
  client — and works fully in mock mode. Unit-tested (calendar-month grouping, last-close-within-month,
  never-observed months, empty set) and an e2e. Descriptive analytics over past prices — not predictive,
  not investment advice.

- **Market-sensitivity analytics (`BETA`).** A new `BETA` / `SENSITIVITY` command shows a single
  instrument's **beta, annualized alpha, R², correlation, and up/down capture** versus a benchmark
  (SPY or QQQ, switchable in-panel) over their aligned daily price histories. A new pure
  `marketSensitivity` helper in `@tyche/analytics` computes it, reusing the existing `beta` /
  `correlation` regression math and **aligning the two series on their common trading dates** (not just
  trimming to equal length, which would misalign returns when coverage differs). Every statistic is
  `null` when there are fewer than two aligned observations or the benchmark is flat — a degenerate
  input never yields a fabricated 0-beta. Reuses the existing `historicalPrices` capability — no new
  capability, route, or API client — and works fully in mock mode. Unit-tested (beta=2 recovery,
  date-alignment, flat-benchmark null, empty set) and an e2e. Descriptive analytics over past prices —
  not predictive, not investment advice.

- **Beneish M-Score completes the forensic scorecard (`SCORE`).** The `SCORE` panel now shows a third
  screen alongside Altman Z′ and Piotroski F: the **Beneish M-Score** (1999 eight-variable
  earnings-manipulation model — DSRI, GMI, AQI, SGI, DEPI, SGAI, TATA, LVGI). A new `beneishMScore` in
  `@tyche/analytics` computes it from the two most recent annual periods; the score is `null` (never a
  partial weighted probit) unless all eight indices are computable, and a value above −1.78 is labeled
  **"elevated risk"** — explicitly a prompt to scrutinize, **not an accusation of manipulation** (the
  screen has a high false-positive rate; two disclosed simplifications from the mapped line items: its
  AQI omits long-term securities and its LVGI uses total liabilities / total assets). To feed it, the mapped
  balance sheet gains two standard line items — **accounts receivable** and **net property, plant &
  equipment** — in both the mock and the real SEC company-facts adapter (also enriching the FA balance
  view). Reuses the existing keyless `fundamentals` capability — no new capability, route, or API client —
  and works fully in mock mode. Unit-tested (worked M-Score example, elevated-flag case, incomplete-null
  handling) and the SCORE e2e extended. `MSCORE` added as a command alias. Descriptive analytics over
  reported filings — not a rating, signal, or investment advice.

- **Performance & risk snapshot (`PERF`).** A new `PERF` / `PERFORMANCE` / `RETURNS` command shows a
  single-instrument multi-horizon readout over the price history the terminal already fetches: **trailing
  total returns** for 1W / 1M / 3M / 6M / YTD / 1Y / 3Y, plus **annualized volatility, max drawdown,
  current drawdown-from-high, Sharpe, best/worst day, and % positive days**. A new pure `performanceStats`
  helper in `@tyche/analytics` computes it (reusing the existing `volatility` / `maxDrawdown` /
  `sharpeRatio` risk math). Trailing returns are **anchored to the last candle's date, not the wall clock**,
  so the readout is deterministic and reproducible; each horizon returns `null` (never a fabricated figure)
  when the loaded history doesn't reach back that far, YTD uses the prior calendar year's close, and month
  cutoffs are day-clamped (1M before Mar 31 is Feb 28/29, not Mar 2). Reuses the existing `historicalPrices`
  capability — no new capability, route, or API client — and works fully in mock mode. Unit-tested
  (date-anchored horizons, month-clamp, drawdown/best-worst/positive-rate, single-candle and empty sets) and
  an e2e. Descriptive analytics over past prices — not predictive, not investment advice.

- **Fundamental scorecard (`SCORE`).** A new `SCORE` / `FSCORE` / `ZSCORE` command computes two classic
  quant screens over the SEC financial statements the terminal already fetches: the **Altman Z′-Score**
  (financial-distress composite) and the **Piotroski F-Score** (9-point fundamental-strength checklist).
  A new pure `scoring` helper in `@tyche/analytics` (`altmanZScore`, `piotroskiFScore`,
  `fundamentalScorecard`) implements both — the Z′ uses the market-cap-free book-equity variant so it
  needs no price input (EBIT = operating income; solvency term X4 = book equity / total liabilities), and
  the F-Score compares the two most recent annual periods signal-by-signal (its leverage signal uses
  total debt / total assets). Honesty guards: the Z′ total is reported `null` (never
  a partial sum) when any of the five components is missing, and each F-Score signal is `✓`/`✗`/`—`
  (not-evaluable) so a checklist with missing inputs reads as "N/9 evaluable" rather than a fabricated 9.
  To support them, the mapped balance sheet gains two line items — **retained earnings** and **shares
  outstanding** — in both the mock and the real SEC company-facts adapter (also enriching the FA balance
  view). Reuses the existing keyless `fundamentals` capability — no new capability, route, or API client —
  and works fully in mock mode. Unit-tested (worked Z′ example, incomplete-null handling, full 9/9 and
  no-prior-year F-Score, dilution signal, quarterly-noise filtering, empty set) and an e2e. Descriptive
  analytics over reported filings — not a rating, signal, or investment advice.

- **Material events (8-K) timeline (`MEVT`).** A new `MEVT` / `8K` / `MATERIAL` command surfaces a
  company's SEC Form 8-K current reports as a plain-language material-events timeline. The EDGAR
  submissions feed the terminal already fetches for `CF` now also carries each filing's filer-tagged
  8-K **item codes**; a new pure `eightKEvents` helper in `@tyche/analytics` decodes them against the
  authoritative SEC 8-K item taxonomy (e.g. `2.02` Results of Operations, `5.02` Officer/Director
  change, `1.05` Material Cybersecurity Incident, `9.01` Exhibits), groups them into a newest-first
  timeline with a per-category tally, and reports first/last dates. Honesty guards: an unknown/garbled
  code is echoed verbatim (`Item x.xx`, flagged unknown) rather than given an invented label, and an
  8-K the filer left untagged is shown as "items not tagged" instead of being dropped or guessed.
  Reuses the existing keyless `filings` capability — no new capability, route, or API client — and
  works fully in mock mode. Unit-tested (decode, variants, category tally, untagged, limit) and an
  e2e. Descriptive filing data — not a signal, not investment advice.

- **Insider-activity summary (INSD → Summary view).** The `INSD` panel gains a
  **Transactions | Summary** toggle. A new pure `insiderActivity` helper in `@tyche/analytics`
  aggregates the Form 3/4/5 transactions already on screen into **net buying/selling** (shares and,
  where priced, dollar value), distinct-insider counts, **cluster-buy / cluster-sell** flags (≥3
  distinct insiders on one side), first/last dates, and a per-role breakdown (Director / Officer /
  10% Owner / Other, biggest net first). Only A/D transactions attribute to a side; non-directional
  rows (e.g. a Form 3 initial statement) still count but aren't taken as a buy or sell, and value is
  summed only over priced transactions. Pure, dependency-free, empty-safe analytics over data the
  terminal already fetches — no new data source, capability, or route. Unit-tested (netting, priced
  value, cluster threshold, role bucketing, dates, empty set) and an e2e. Descriptive summary of
  reported filings — not a signal, not investment advice.

- **13F quarter-over-quarter changes (INST → Changes view).** The `INST` panel gains a
  **Snapshot | Changes** toggle. `getInstitutionalChanges` diffs a manager's two most recent full
  13F-HR reports into **new buys / adds / trims / exits** with per-position Δshares, Δ%, current
  weight, and prior→current report dates, ordered by the dollar value moved and summarized by counts.
  It reuses the same parser + aggregation as the snapshot (a shared per-filing loader) and a pure,
  tested `diffPortfolios` — positions match on the same `cusip + putCall + sharesType` identity, so a
  put overlay's move stays distinct from the common line, and `unchanged` positions are dropped. With
  a single report on file, every position reads as `new`; any missing filing / unparseable table
  degrades to an empty-but-valid diff. The mock synthesizes a plausible prior quarter (with a real new
  buy and an exit) so the view works keyless. Same `institutionalHoldings` capability, new
  `/api/institutional/:manager/changes` route, CSV/JSON export of the diff. Research-only — it shows
  *reported* quarterly changes, not live trading.

- **Institutional 13F holdings via SEC EDGAR (`13F` command).** A new `institutionalHoldings`
  capability + `13F` / `INST` / `WHALES` command shows what a money manager holds. The
  `SecEdgarProvider` resolves a filer (a raw CIK like `13F 1067983`, or a curated alias like
  `13F BERKSHIRE`), fetches the latest `13F-HR`, locates the filing's information-table XML through
  the accession `index.json`, parses it (dependency-free + namespace-tolerant), aggregates positions
  by CUSIP, and computes each holding's weight as a percent of the total reported value (weight is
  reporting-convention-independent). The manager name shown is EDGAR's authoritative filer name, so a
  wrong alias can never silently mislabel a portfolio; an unresolved manager / missing filing /
  unparseable table degrades to an empty-but-valid portfolio. The mock provider synthesizes a
  plausible book for any manager so the panel works fully keyless (`13F` in mock mode), and the module
  offers a manager input + quick-pick presets, sortable holdings, CSV/JSON export with provenance, and
  the "13F is a delayed, long-only quarterly snapshot" disclaimer. This is manager-centric holdings,
  complementary to the security-centric `ownership`/`HDS`. Fixture-tested (info-table parse incl.
  namespaces + put/call + CUSIP aggregation, CIK/alias resolution, latest-filing selection, graceful
  empties, conformance) with a contract test and an e2e. Research-only; not investment advice.

- **Crypto-first positioning (landing + README).** The landing page and README now lead with the
  data that's real and free today — live crypto depth/funding, on-chain DEX pools, macro, filings
  and news — with equities-via-your-key and open-source self-host as the wedge. Claims corrected to
  match what shipped: seven real adapters (not five), 50+ commands (not 40+), and EOD (not real-time)
  equities via Stooq with real-time as a bring-your-own-key upgrade.

- **Billing go-live runbook.** A `BILLING.md` "Going live: verify, then cut over" section makes
  turning Stripe on turnkey: an optional mock-driver UI dry-run, local webhook testing with the
  Stripe CLI, the test-mode `4242 4242 4242 4242` loop, explicit negative checks (402 before
  upgrade, cancel → paywall with data intact, redirect lands on your domain, no
  `MOCK billing driver active` line in prod logs), and the test→live cutover (Stripe secrets don't
  carry over — recreate the live price + webhook). Completed the prod env example
  (`STRIPE_PRICE_ID_ANNUAL`, `TYCHE_PUBLIC_URL`) and cross-linked LAUNCH.md Day 2. The billing
  server logic itself is already covered end-to-end by `apps/api/src/saas/billing.test.ts`
  (trial→pro, the 402 paywall lifting on upgrade, signed-webhook → entitlement transitions) — this
  is the operator-facing verification path. Docs/config only.

### Security & correctness hardening (adversarial review)

A multi-agent adversarial code review (find → 3-vote refutation) surfaced these
confirmed defects; all are fixed with regression tests:

- **Cross-tenant audit-log leak (hosted) — `GET /api/audit` is now admin-only.**
  The audit ring is one global trail (every account's emails + activity); any
  signed-in tenant could read it. It now requires an admin in hosted mode (the
  self-host bearer guard is unchanged).
- **Stored-XSS via note links.** Markdown link hrefs are allow-listed to
  `http(s)`/`mailto`; an imported note body with `[x](javascript:…)` now renders
  as inert text instead of a clickable script vector.
- **Cross-account workspace leak on a shared browser.** The `localStorage`
  workspace mirror is namespaced by user id in hosted mode, so one account can no
  longer load (or re-save) another's layout. A failed save now surfaces an error
  and rolls the optimistic mirror back instead of showing a false "saved".
- **`/api/quotes` broke equity watchlists when a venue adapter was enabled.**
  The batch endpoint now groups symbols per serving provider (like the SSE hub),
  so `AAPL` routes to a general provider while `BTC-USDT` routes to the venue.
- **Provider plugins could never serve data.** A conformant plugin is registered
  *before* the always-appended mock fallback, so its capabilities actually route
  to it instead of losing to mock.
- **Registration TOCTOU.** Concurrent signups for the same email can no longer
  create duplicate accounts (the email is reserved synchronously before hashing).
- **Rate-limit store (multi-node).** Under lock contention the SQLite backend now
  fails **closed** (denies) instead of 500-ing the auth request, with a shorter
  `busy_timeout`; SECURITY.md scopes the "shared file" claim to a local
  filesystem (WAL doesn't work over NFS).
- **Ops:** the container runs the API via `tsx` directly (pnpm-as-PID-1 swallowed
  SIGTERM, skipping graceful shutdown); `.dockerignore`/`.gitignore` now exclude
  `.env*` and `backups/` (secrets/customer data were baked into images); the
  root `.env` is actually loaded by the API (`--env-file-if-exists`) and Vite
  (`envDir`), which the docs already promised.

### Terminal, data & onboarding polish
- **Argument-level command-bar autocomplete** — after a completed command + space, the bar
  suggests that command's argument vocabulary (e.g. `ECO ` → GDP/UNRATE/CPIAUCSL), sourced from
  each command's own command-first examples so it never drifts from `HELP`.
- **CSV/JSON export parity across table modules** — a shared `TableExport` control (provenance
  header + a JSON option) is wired into every tabular board, so any table exports the same way.
  The last two holdouts now export too: **`EM`** estimates (transposed board → a Metric column plus
  one per fiscal period) and **`OMON`** option chains (flattened to one row per strike with the
  call-side, strike, and put-side columns).
- **`ERN` earnings board** — reported-vs-estimated per metric/period (consensus, low–high range,
  analyst count, actual, surprise %); the last `beta` command promoted to `stable`.
- **`CFV` filing viewer promoted to `stable`** — no `beta`/`stub` commands remain; every command
  now renders a real component (guarded by `assertModuleCoverage()`).
- **`CHANGELOG` command** — in-app release history rendered from this file (bundled at build time,
  so it works offline and in the read-only demo).
- **`TOUR` command** — replays the 30-second keyboard tour on demand in any mode; shares its
  content with the first-login onboarding screen so the two never drift.

### SaaS retention & billing

- **Trial-lifecycle emails (hosted)** — a day-11 "trial ending" nudge and a day-2 "welcome back"
  re-engagement mail run on a background tick, each sent at most once per account (persisted
  markers, so a restart never double-sends) and audited. Gated on a real email sender: under the
  keyless console sink the campaign is disabled with a one-time warning, never a crash.
- **Annual plan (second Stripe price)** — an optional `STRIPE_PRICE_ID_ANNUAL` adds a yearly plan
  selectable at checkout; `ACCOUNT` offers Monthly and Annual ("2 months free") for trialers and
  shows the current interval once subscribed. When the annual price is unset, an annual checkout
  transparently falls back to monthly. The mock driver supports both, so the flow is demoable
  keyless.
- **Team / seat mode (hosted, closed signups)** — provision seats by invite: `ADMIN` shows
  `Seats: used / limit` and a Team panel to invite or revoke; the invitee gets an emailed single-use
  link that creates their (pre-verified) account and drops them into onboarding. A seat is an
  account **or** an outstanding invite, so a capped instance (`TYCHE_SEATS`) can't be
  oversubscribed. Seats gate access only — billing stays per-account.

### Real data breadth

- **Real fundamentals from SEC EDGAR (US issuers)** — `SecEdgarProvider` now serves the
  `fundamentals` capability from the XBRL company-facts API, so with `SEC_EDGAR_USER_AGENT` set,
  `AAPL FA` returns real income / balance / cash-flow statements (`mode: public`) instead of the
  mock. us-gaap concepts map onto the same rows the mock used; periods are selected from SEC's
  calendar frames (annual + quarterly) with restatement dedupe; a data gap falls back to an empty
  panel, and the whole thing stays keyless with mock fallback when no User-Agent is configured.

### Terminal UX

- **Layout quick-switch chords** — `⌘/Ctrl + 1…9` jump straight to your 1st–9th saved layout (in
  creation order, so the number is stable). Every chord is rebindable in `SETTINGS` and persisted,
  and the `LAYOUT` panel shows each layout's `⌘N` badge.

### Operability

- **Broader e2e coverage + a flake fix** — Playwright journeys now cover `FX`, `HEAT`, `BOOK`, and
  `FUND` alongside the existing set, and the long-standing `LAYOUT` test is fixed (it now uses a
  run-unique layout name, so the persisted-workspace store can't accumulate collisions). The full
  browser suite runs green.
- **External-SIEM audit sink** — set `TYCHE_AUDIT_SINK=http` + `TYCHE_AUDIT_WEBHOOK_URL` (optional
  bearer token) to stream every audit event off-box to a SIEM / HTTP collector. Delivery is
  fire-and-forget with a timeout and is flushed on shutdown; a failing endpoint is logged but never
  breaks the action it records, and an unconfigured URL degrades to the console sink with a warning.
- **Pluggable rate-limit store (multi-node)** — the credential rate limiter now sits behind a
  `RateLimitStore` interface: `memory` (default, node-local) or `sqlite` (`TYCHE_RATE_LIMIT_STORE=sqlite`),
  a shared `rate_hits` DB so every API node pointing at one file enforces a single credential budget
  instead of `limit × nodes`. SQLite failures fall back to memory with a boot warning. The interface
  is the seam for a Redis-backed store. `SECURITY.md` now documents the shared backend **and** the
  multi-node session-revocation boundary (the `tokenEpoch` lever is instant across nodes only when
  the user registry is shared; the file registry caches in memory, so pin sticky sessions or run one
  node — a shared read-through registry is the tracked follow-up).

### Launch hygiene (Week-1 pass)
- **CI gates every PR on the 35-test Playwright e2e suite** (Chromium installed and cached per
  Playwright version; report artifact on failure). The config falls back from the dev container's
  provided browser to Playwright's own.
- **Tag-triggered release workflow** — `git push origin vX.Y.Z` re-verifies the commit, creates a
  GitHub Release with the matching CHANGELOG section as notes, and publishes the self-host image
  to `ghcr.io/<owner>/tyche` (`:vX.Y.Z` + `:latest`).
- **Web bundle code-split** — one 522 KB chunk → 225 KB entry + a long-cacheable vendor chunk +
  52 on-demand module chunks (~12 KB max); first-paint JS down to 111.5 KB gzipped.
- **README + landing refreshed to launch reality** — 41 stable commands, 24 capabilities, five
  real adapters; fresh in-repo screenshots (research desk, sector treemap, DEX pools) and a real
  1200×630 og-image; GHCR pull is now the fastest demo path.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-07-02 · "The parity release"

Four competitive batches in one release, closing the research-backed Gödel/Midas parity backlog:
crypto market structure (Binance adapter, `BOOK`, `FUND`), market visualization (`HEAT`, `MEMB`,
chart zoom/pan/log), the FX pack (Frankfurter adapter, `FX`, keyboard charting), and the on-chain
pack (Dexscreener adapter, `DEX`, `COMM`). Tyche now ships 40 commands, 24 typed capabilities, and
five real keyless-or-free adapters — and CI gates every PR on the full 35-test browser suite.

### On-chain DEX pools + commodities board (batch 4)
- **Dexscreener adapter** — fifth real adapter, keyless: on-chain DEX pool search across chains
  and venues (price, 24h volume/change, **liquidity depth**, FDV, buy/sell counts), sorted
  deepest-liquidity first, cached + throttled, enabled via `TYCHE_PROVIDERS=dexscreener` (alias
  `dex`). Declares *only* `dexPools`, so it never intercepts quote/chart/stream routing.
- **`DEX`** (aliases `ONCHAIN`, `POOLS`) — on-chain pools panel: query defaults to the active
  symbol's base token, retypeable in-panel; rows link out to the source pool page. `dexPools`
  becomes the **24th typed capability** (contract, conformance probe, deterministic mock pools,
  `GET /api/dex?q=`).
- **`COMM`** (aliases `CMDTY`, `COMMODITIES`, `GLCO`) — commodities board grouped
  Energy/Metals/Agriculture with change/%/YTD; six commodity seeds (gold, silver, copper, WTI,
  natural gas, wheat) make it fully demoable keyless, and the mock now declares `futures`.

### Crypto market-structure pack (Gödel-parity+, the "premium Midas" axis)
- **Binance adapter** — real, keyless public crypto data: quotes, candles (daily + intraday),
  aggregated trades with aggressor side, L2 order books, and perp **funding rates**. Pairs use
  dash notation (`BTC-USDT`); no silent USD→USDT mapping.
- **Symbol-aware provider routing** — providers can scope themselves to their own universe
  (`servesSymbol`), so one watchlist streams `AAPL` from one provider and `BTC-USDT` from another;
  live data is never jittered by the demo walk.
- **`BOOK`** (aliases `DOM`, `DEPTH`) — Level-2 depth ladder with cumulative size bars, spread/mid
  row, and bid-share imbalance. Works keyless in mock mode for any symbol.
- **`FUND`** (aliases `FUNDING`, `FUNDR`) — perpetual funding board: per-interval rate, annualized
  carry, mark price, next-funding countdown; narrows to the active symbol.
- **`fundingRates`** becomes the 22nd typed capability (contract, conformance probe, mock
  implementation, capability dashboard).
- Aggregated `/api/search` merges results across every quote-capable provider.

### Market visualization & charting depth (parity batch 2)
- **`HEAT`** (aliases `MAP`, `TREEMAP`) — squarified market treemap over the screener universe:
  tile area by market cap or volume, a **validated diverging red↔gray↔green fill** on % change
  (signed % always shown as text — never color-alone), click-to-retarget, live polling.
- **`MEMB`** (aliases `MEMBERS`, `CONSTITUENTS`) — index/ETF constituents and weights;
  `membership` becomes the 23rd typed capability (contract, conformance probe, synthetic mock
  boards for SPX/NDX/DJI/SPY/QQQ, `GET /api/membership/:symbol`).
- **Charting depth** — wheel zoom anchored at the cursor, drag-to-pan, double-click/one-click
  reset, and a **log price scale** (round-number ticks at correct geometric spacing) on the shared
  chart surface used by `GP` and `GIP`.

### FX pack + accessibility depth (batch 3)
- **Frankfurter adapter** — fourth real adapter, keyless: daily ECB reference rates for ~30
  currencies (`fx`, quotes, daily history for pairs like `EUR-USD`). Flat EOD candles — honest
  about a one-fixing-per-day source. Binance now declines fiat/fiat pairs so FX and crypto route
  cleanly side by side.
- **`FX`** (aliases `FXC`, `CURRENCY`) — majors board with daily change + an amount converter
  (direct or inverse rate); rows retarget linked panels; FX seed pairs make it demoable keyless.
- **Sector-grouped HEAT** — two-level squarified treemap (sectors sized by summed weight, labeled
  strips, members nested inside).
- **Keyboard chart navigation** — the chart is focusable: ←/→ step the crosshair (Shift ×10),
  Home/End jump, +/− zoom, 0 resets, Esc clears — fully keyboard-driven chart reading.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-07-01 · "The SaaS release"

Tyche becomes a launch-ready product: the same keyboard-first terminal, now runnable as a hosted,
billable service — strictly opt-in, with the self-host experience unchanged.

### Hosted mode (`TYCHE_MODE=hosted`)
- **Accounts** — email/password sign-up (scrypt-hashed, per-user salts), stateless HMAC cookie
  sessions (30-day, survive restarts), sign-up control (`TYCHE_SIGNUPS`, `TYCHE_ADMIN_EMAIL`).
- **Hard per-user data isolation** — every account gets its own persistence store
  (`data/users/<id>`), bound per-request via `AsyncLocalStorage`; zero route churn.
- **Auth hardening** — per-IP rate limiting on credential endpoints (429), password change with
  session invalidation (`tokenEpoch`), audit events for every auth outcome.

### Billing
- 14-day free trial (no card) seeded at registration; expired trials hit a **402 paywall** that
  keeps auth/billing reachable and deletes nothing. Admins are never paywalled.
- **Driver interface**: `mock` (instant local loop for dev/tests) and `stripe` (Checkout, customer
  Portal, signature-verified webhooks over plain REST). Boot refuses misconfigured Stripe.
- `ACCOUNT` command: plan/status, upgrade, manage billing, change password, **export my data**
  (full-account JSON), sign out. Header trial countdown chip.

### Onboarding & operator
- First-login **role presets** (trader / equity researcher / macro / blank) seed a working
  workspace through the real command path; 30-second keyboard tour; shown exactly once.
- `ADMIN` founder dashboard: accounts, trial funnel, **MRR**, active today/this week, 14-day
  signups timeline, latest accounts.

### Launch kit
- `scripts/deploy.sh` — one-command production deploy (compose + Caddy automatic HTTPS, generated
  secrets, fail-loud misconfig). `marketing/landing.html` — self-contained landing page with
  honest data-posture positioning. `docs/BILLING.md`, `docs/LAUNCH.md` (7-day checklist + 30-day
  roadmap), beta-invite email and X launch-thread templates.

### Terminal (from the revamp cycles)
- Charting realism: labelled axes, gridlines, volume pane, crosshair OHLCV readout, last-price
  marker — daily (`GP`) and intraday (`GIP`).
- Command palette v2: ranked autocomplete (prefix → alias → fuzzy → title) + live symbol search.
- Named workspace layouts (`LAYOUT`), corporate events calendar (`EVT`) with market sessions,
  Docker one-command demo, first-run demo workspace.

## 0.1.0 — foundation

Clean-room terminal foundation: contracts (Zod), terminal kernel (parser/registry/executor),
provider capability model with deterministic mock + real SEC EDGAR and FRED adapters, module SDK,
Fastify API with SSE streaming, React tiling workspace with 30+ modules, plugin host with
conformance gating, SQLite/file persistence, audit log, optional bearer auth.
